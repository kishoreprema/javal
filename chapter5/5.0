Primitive types

In JavaScript, a primitive (primitive value, primitive data type) is data that is not an object and has no methods.
 There are 7 primitive data types: 
 string, number, bigint, boolean, undefined, symbol, and null.

 These are the 7 primitive data types

Numbers, strings and booleans are basic value units. You can write them out
in literal form: a number can be 123 or 3.14, a string can be "string", or
a template string: ‘I have {$number} apples.‘ (note the back-tick quotes,
which allow you to embed variables into the string dynamically.) A boolean can
only be either true or false. You can combine primitive types using operators,
pass them to functions or assign them as values to object properties.
Number(), BigInt(), String() and Boolean() are primitive constructor func-
tions. We’ll explore constructor functions and classes at a proper time in the
book. First, let’s briefly go over each primitive individually.
