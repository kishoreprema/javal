VARIABLE :
Variables
Value Placeholders
Variables are placeholder names for different types of values.
Keywords for defining variables include: var, let and const.

Dynamic Typing
JavaScript is a dynamically-typed language. It means that variables created using
var or let keywords can be dynamically re-assigned to a value of another type at
some point later in your JavaScript program.
In statically-typed languages doing that would generate an error.

Declaration :
declaring an value to an object.
