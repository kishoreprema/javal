EXPRESSION :
 Expressions donâ€™t have to be variable definitions. You can create them
by simply using some literal values in combination with operators.

EG:
  3 + 4;

  There is another distinct types of an expression in JavaScript:

  let f = function() {return 1};
  f();
Function f() evaluates to value 1, because it returns 1. This is why f() is often
referred to as a function expression.
